 <strong>What is 3D Animation?</strong><br><br>

Sometimes referred to as 3D CGI, 3D animation is a type of animation that uses computer generated images to create animated scenes.<br><br><br>

<strong>What is a Visual Effects Animator?</strong><br><br>

A visual effects animator is the individual responsible for inserting special
 effects into films; effects that cannot be added during live action shooting.
 A great example is <br><br>when the green screen is used during shots of actors in a
 studio, and an exciting background is added later. These professionals may even
 create entire characters <br><br>through computer software programs and integrate them
 into the film, even allowing them to interact with live action characters. They
 work to increase the realism and <br><br>excitement of television shows, films, commercials and other projects.<br><br><br>
 
 <strong>What is Cartooning?</strong><br><br>

Cartooning is the process of drawing still cartoons, which are usually meant to be
 humorous. These cartoons are often featured in print publications, like magazines
 and <br><br>newspapers, as well as online publications, like blogs and websites. Sometimes
 cartoons will consist of just one picture, while others will consist of several
 pictures. This <br><br>type of cartoon is often referred to as a comic strip. A very long 
 series of cartoons, on the other hand, is often referred to as a graphic novel.

Characters and scenes in <br><br>most cartoons are generally not drawn realistically. Instead,
 most features are exaggerated, and people and animals may appear to be caricatures or
 "cartoonish". Many <br><br>cartoons also have some sort of caption, or speech and thought bubbles 
 can be used to make the characters' words or actions apparent.
